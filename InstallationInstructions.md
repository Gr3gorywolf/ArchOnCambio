## Perform Windows Hardware Dumps

## Making Bootable USB

## Getting Into the BIOS

The [vendor-provided instructions](https://rcaav.com/faq_support/i-need-to-enter-the-bios-of-the-tablet-w101v2/)
on how to get into the BIOS does *not* work, at first, because the Windows EFI boot loader 
preempts it.  Hitting ESC seems to work after Windows has been blown away completely, 
however I did discover that holding the Volume-Up and Power-On buttons simultaneously does 
in fact work.  Use this method if you want Windows 10 to never be booted at all, and maybe 
you'll get lucky in claiming a refund from Microsoft, further reducing the cost of your 
low-end tablet :)
