# Arch Linux on RCA Cambio 10.1" (w101 v2)
Installing and configuring Arch Linux on the
[RCA Cambio model w101v2](https://shop.rcaav.com/shop/computing/2-in-1/cambio-w101v2)

# Status

As of about 8/10/2018,  Arch is installed and I have xorg with LXDE working well enough 
that this can be used comfortably enough as a laptop.  I've worked through plenty of 
issues already, and there are plenty remaining, but I'm confident these will all be 
resolved in time and that this will be my everyday device.

# Installation instructions

TBD (in progess)

# To Do

- Finish getting touchscreen calibrated
- Get sound working
- Get auto-rotate working via accelerometer
- Get Front and Rear cameras working (ov2680 on i2c bus)
